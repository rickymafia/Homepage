<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com){:target="\_blank"}. You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/){:target="\_blank"} and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/){:target="\_blank"}, like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
I am a third-year Ph.D. student at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/){:target="\_blank"}, advised by [René Vidal](http://cis.jhu.edu/~rvidal/){:target="\_blank"} and [Benjamin D. Haeffele](https://www.cis.jhu.edu/~haeffele/){:target="\_blank"}. I also work closely with [Yi Ma](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~yima/){:target="\_blank"}. Prior to joining Hopkins, I spent two years as a research assistant at [ShanghaiTech University](https://sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/sist_en/){:target="\_blank"}, advised by [Manolis C. Tsakiris](https://sites.google.com/site/manolisctsakiris/){:target="\_blank"} and collaborating with [Laurent Kneip](https://laurentkneip.com/){:target="\_blank"}. I received my undergraduate degree in computer science with honor from [ShanghaiTech](https://sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/sist_en/){:target="\_blank"}, working with [Manolis](https://sites.google.com/site/manolisctsakiris/){:target="\_blank"} and [Yi](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~yima/){:target="\_blank"}.

My research interests lie in the theoretical foundations of machine learning and data science as well as emerging applications. As such, I develop both rigorous mathematics and practical implementations in my work. In particular, I study manifold learning and clustering, 3D vision and robotics.

I love to [talk about ideas relevant to my work](https://calendly.com/tianjiao){:target="\_blank"}. If you are a student interested in doing research with me, please email me with your CV and transcript. For master's students and undergraduates, the minimum time commitment is 15 hours per week for six months.
